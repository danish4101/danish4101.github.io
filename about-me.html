      <p>
        Hi, I'm Danish! I have a deep passion for coding and love the thrill of
        debugging and solving complex problems. Most of my free time is
        dedicated to learning new skills and staying up-to-date with the latest
        technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favorite framework is React, and I enjoy building interactive and
        dynamic web applications with it. I believe in the power of technology
        to create innovative solutions and enhance user experiences.
